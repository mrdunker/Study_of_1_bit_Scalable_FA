# Study_of_1_bit_Scalable_FA

## INTRODUCTION

The rapid advancement of transistor scaling has led to a significant surge in research efforts concerning the low-power design of micro-electronic circuits. The need for high performance microelectronic circuit design has consequently increased dramatically.<br />

Large-scale arithmetic operations are necessary for many modern applications, including digital signal processing (DSP) chips, microprocessors, and image and video processing operations.<br />

This paper proposes a new hybrid FA that makes use of static CMOS logic, PTs, and TGs. Using Cadence tools, the FA was implemented in 45 nm technology. A  thorough analysis of the performance parameters of the proposed design have supply voltages ranging from 0.4 V to 1.2 V was done to assess the reliability.<br />

In addition, the FA has been extended to include wide word length adders to evaluate their performance characteristics in extensive circuits.

## DESIGN â€“ FULL ADDER APPROACH

The model put forward has divided the architecture into four modules for generating the sum and carry bits. Two modules are allocated for sum and two for carry generation.<br />
